A learning project to implement a graphics library, starting with nothing but a minifb-provided pixel buffer and working upwards to full software-rendered 3D graphics. 

Currently supports:
- loading and displaying tga image files
- rendering text using bitmap fonts
- loading waveform OBJ 3D model files
- rendering textured 3D polygons and models (rendered in software)
- rendering graphical primitives (lines and triangles)

Note: this project is built in a very ad-hoc way. It is not yet structured as a reusable crate that can be used with other projects, as it was primarly a teaching tool for myself to understand 3D computer graphics.
