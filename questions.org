* How "far along" is this?
About as much as I want!

* How much work do I need to display a triangle on the screen?
None at all, its already done.

* What are homogenous coordinates for?

Normally when you use a 2x2 matrix it lacks the constants, so if you use a 3x3 matrix and then just use 1 as the third value in the vector it works. 

* How do I represent a polygon?

The naiive idea is to simply create a struct with x/y/z fields.

* When drawing the polygon, can I discard the third value or do I need to divide the other two by it?

For now lets discard, if it looks funny we will divide. 

So far so good... Though all of them are just 1 for now, so it means nothing really. 

* How do I /rotate/ a triangle. 

It involved like, a sinus, didn't it.
